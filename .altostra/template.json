  /* This is a template of a template.
   * When initializing new repository from this one, You must do the following:
   *
   * Set the 'name' field to an actual meaningful name
   * Set the 'description' field with a good description of what this project-template is
   * Place a single valid blueprint in the 'blueprints' array
   * Optionally, add glob patterns to the 'includes' and/or 'excludes' arrays
   *  Please note, you must use only globs for files (not directories)
   *  If you wish to include/exclude all files in a directory, use '**'
   *    BAD glob pattern: "/files-dir"
   *    GOOD glob pattern: "/files-dir/**"
